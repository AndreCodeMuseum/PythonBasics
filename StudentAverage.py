# Read to grades of a student exam and tell its average and if his grade is equal or higher than 6 he has passed the exam

examOne = float(input("1ยบ Exam: "))
examTwo = float(input("2ยบ Exam: "))

# Calculation

averageGrade = (examOne + examTwo) / 2


if averageGrade >= 6:
    print("Well done!, You've passed the exam")
else:
    print("Sorry, you've failed the exam")
